username = jimmy_user
passwd = jimmy123

//add users to mysql for local host only
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jimbo_db1.* TO 'jimmy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'jimmy123';

//this allows any ip address access to mysql which allows to connect from outside the server
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON yourDBname.* TO username@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

//sample, this gives user=jimmy full access and to be connected via any ip address.
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO jimmy@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

//this gives full access to only db=jimbo_db1 user=jimmy
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jimbo_db1.* TO jimmy@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
