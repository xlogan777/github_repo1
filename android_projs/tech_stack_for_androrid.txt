these are tips of where to find stuff when u run modelio. default workspace is here.
this is the workspace of where projects get placed, when they are created.

FOR NOW JUST USE FOR MODELLING, MAYBE TO CODE GENERATE...NOT SURE YET..
to generate java code from files, it will tag a file as a type of java code. 
then do a generate for that file.
