2 vCPU with 8GB ram.

aws pricing for 3 servers
	for 3 servers = 534(for 8 months) * 3 = 1602
        1 server for 1 month = 534/8 = 66.75
	I have used AWS before so i have experience on it.

google cloud pricing for 3 servers 
	for 3 servers = 437 * 3= 1311
        1 server for 1 month = 437/8 = 54.62
	Should be similar stuff to AWS but never setup anything here.
